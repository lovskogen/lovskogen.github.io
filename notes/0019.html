		<h1>Watching 80s and 90s films</h1>

			<p>There's something comforting about films from '84 to '94. Before the fast-moving internet, but still relatable. Things did not happen at instant speed, characters had to travel and meet up in person, slowly. In the evening only the landline could interrupt, and they did not spend most of their time on screens. It was simpler, even with its added complexity – and that makes them calming to watch.</p>
